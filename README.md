# ZehyrRTOS_Bascis

Hi there,this is a repository to get started with Zephyr RTOS. I'll add more as I get time to work these.

### Instructions to run these examples.
1. Install Zephyr SDK. (Link given below).
2. Clone the repo.
3. Go to porject dir and build. (For eg `cd DHT11` -> `west build` -> `west flash`)  

Note:
- README's inside the exmaples might be incomplete. (I'll be updating these).
- Check the boards folder for boards override to find the board compatibility for specific projects. 

### Important Links:
- [Zephyr OS Installation Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)

### Why Zephyr RTOS:
- Fully Open Source (Maintained by Linux Foundation).
- Highly Portable (Using Device Trees).
- Scalabel and rapidly growing drivers and tools support.
- Wide range of open source stacks (From CAN bus to LoRaWan,BLE).
